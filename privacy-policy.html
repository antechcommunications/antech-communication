                <h2>2. Why We Collect Information</h2>
                <p>We collect data to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Provide Services:</strong> Your personal and service data is required to activate new services, process orders, plan upgrades, and execute account changes such as cancellations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Customer Support:</strong> We use your contact and service data to provide technical support and resolve any issues.</li>
                    <li><strong>Billing and Payments:</strong> Your financial data is used to process payments for services, including our execution charges, which are clearly disclosed on our website and range from $49.99 to $199.99.</li>

                </ul>

                <h2>3. Third-Party Service Providers</h2>
                <p>Antech Communications partners with third-party vendors, including payment processors and JNA-certified service providers such as AT&T, Verizon, Spectrum, Xfinity, Dish, and others.

                <h2>4. Mobile Information and Data Sharing Policy</h2>

                    <li><strong>Subscription Fees:</strong> All recurring charges are clearly explained in advance to avoid any confusion.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We do not engage in any misleading or dishonest pricing practices, ensuring that all costs are transparent to the user before they make a commitment.</p>

                        <h3>SMS Campaign Provisioning Notice</h3>
                    </div>
                    <p><strong>Important:</strong> Your SMS campaign has not been provisioned because of the following reason: <strong>Webform requires TN; update CTA/missing disclaimer.</strong></p>
                    <p>Your website has a form (Contact) which collects phone numbers mandatorily. You must add the Zoom-provided disclosure below the form.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Required SMS Disclosure</h3>

                <h3>Privacy Policy Requirements</h3>
                <p>Your privacy policy does not explicitly state how you share your consumer's data. We have added the following carve-out message to ensure compliance:</p>

                    <p class="carveout-text">
