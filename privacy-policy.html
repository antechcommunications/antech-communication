                <p><strong>Service Data:</strong><br>
                Data related to the service you are receiving through Antech Communications, such as account numbers, service type, and technical support logs. This data is collected via forms, cookies, and interactions with our platform or customer service team.</p>

                <h2>2. Why We Collect Information</h2>
                <p>We collect data to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Provide Services:</strong> Your personal and service data is required to activate new services, process orders, plan upgrades, and execute account changes such as cancellations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Customer Support:</strong> We use your contact and service data to provide technical support and resolve any issues.</li>
                    <li><strong>Billing and Payments:</strong> Your financial data is used to process payments for services, including our execution charges, which are clearly disclosed on our website and range from $49.99 to $199.99.</li>
                    <li><strong>Improvement and Marketing:</strong> With your consent, we use non-identifying data to improve our services, assess site traffic, and offer promotions aligned with your preferences. We ensure that any data collected is transparent, and we fully comply with Google's guidelines by not misrepresenting any element of our services or the fees associated with them.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>3. Third-Party Service Providers</h2>
                <p>Antech Communications partners with third-party vendors, including payment processors and JNA-certified service providers such as AT&T, Verizon, Spectrum, Xfinity, Dish, and others. While we ensure they adhere to strict privacy standards, we encourage you to review their privacy policies for more details about their data-handling practices.</p>

                <h2>4. Transparency in Pricing and Billing</h2>

                    <li><strong>Separate Billing:</strong> Execution fees charged by Antech Communications are separate from charges by your service provider (such as Verizon, Xfinity, or Spectrum), which will be outlined in your agreement with the provider.</li>
                    <li><strong>Subscription Fees:</strong> All recurring charges are clearly explained in advance to avoid any confusion.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We do not engage in any misleading or dishonest pricing practices, ensuring that all costs are transparent to the user before they make a commitment.</p>

                <h2>5. Data Security</h2>

                    <li><strong>Secure Payment Gateways:</strong> We use industry-standard, third-party payment processors to handle transactions securely.</li>
                </ul>
